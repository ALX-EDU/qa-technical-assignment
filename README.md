Thank you for taking the time to do the TheRoom QA Technical Assignment. 

Please read both **API-Task.md** and **UI-Task.md** and follow the instructions within.

Please do not spend too much time on these exercises, we're assessing quality over quanitty.

When assessing your tests, we will take the following things into account:

* Design of your framework
* Code quality
* Code clarity
* Wording of your tests
* How easily we can run the tests
* Documentation

You might be required to walk future interviewers through your code, and pair on making some modifications to your framework.

### What happens next? 
Our team will review your submission. If it meets the needs of our current available positions, you will be invited for a final face-to-face interview. 
At this stage, we will have a friendly chat in order to understand how you approached the problem.
