Thank you for taking the time to do the TheRoom QA Technical Assignment. When assessing your tests, we will take the following things into account:

* Design of your framework
* Code quality
* Code clarity
* Wording of your tests
* How easily we can run the tests
* Documentation

You might be required to walk future interviewers through your code, and pair on making some modifications to your framework.
