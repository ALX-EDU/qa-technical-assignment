# TheRoom Technical Test - QA (API)

### Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do the TheRoom QA technical Assignment

We would like you to take a look at this sample ToDo App <https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/>

Using a test framework of your choice, in a language of your choice, please write a few tests covering some of the page functionality.

When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:

  - Design of your framework
  - Code quality
  - Code clarity
  - Wording of your tests
  - How easily we can run the tests
  - Documentation 

### Languages
You may use any language of your choice. We would prefer that you use a language that will help you show off your skills in building test automation frameworks, rather than one that you are unfamiliar with.

At TheRoom we mostly use Javascript and Typescript full stack.

### Documentation
You should provide complete instructions on how to run your tests, and note any pre requisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README.
The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.

### Submission
Create a public repository on github with your code and send us the link.
